# Boolean values are True or False - you can use these to check state and then make programming choices based on their value
player = False

# add player and computer lives
playerLives = 5
computerLives = 5

# save the player as a variable called player
# the value of player will be one of the five choices to type (input)

# player = input("Choose rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock: ")
# computer = choices[randint(0,4)]
